__Overview__
```
1. Add GDAL Georeferencer in Manage Plugins
2. Use add control point tool, and Map Canvas option to create control points
3. Transform the image and load to map view
```
<br>
Because the Georefencer in QGIS works by switching back and forth to the Map Canvas, please see the video linked above for an explanation of the process.
